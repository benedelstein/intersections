# intersections
what is the probability of two cars crashing at an N-way stop sign?

Simulations on cars intersecting at an N-way intersection. See my blog post on why the crash rate is 1/3 as N->infinity.

**To Use**

intersections.py contains the algorithm for each individual scenario.
every other file makes use of that algorithm to plot out different distributions and ways of looking at the data.
